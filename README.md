`v1.0.0` &mdash; 08/01/2016

When you don't have any idea for your next Dribbble shot, [Stimulus](http://nilvila.ga/stimulus) is the perfect tool. **Stimulus** is a simple website, inspired by [UI Names](http://uinames.co), that randomly generates an UI Element.

## Usage
To generate an idea you just have to press the Spacebar &mdash; on touch devices you can also press anywhere of the screen. To generate another one, press the Spacebar &mdash; or tap the screen &mdash; again.

## Contribute
I would be very glad if you suggest an idea to include in the list. To do this, please fill up [this form](http://goo.gl/forms/y0oOOlNfV4). I don't ask you any personal data except the username, which is optional.
